## ExaSearch WebApp
- About:
  - I've developed a user-friendly web application utilizing Streamlit, designed to facilitate seamless content searches on Wikipedia. Leveraging the exa-api, users can access Wikipedia's vast repository of information directly through the app. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious, this tool offers a convenient way to explore and discover knowledge.
  - I used `exa_py` and `streamlit` packages in this project check out everything about it from the below @Furthurmore section.
